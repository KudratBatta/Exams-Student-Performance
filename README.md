# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Classifier

This project uses the **"Students Performance in Exams"** dataset from Kaggle to predict whether a student will score **above 70 in math** based on demographic and academic features. The final model achieves **>95% accuracy** using advanced feature engineering and ensemble learning.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

- **Source**: [Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- **Columns**:
  - Gender, Race/Ethnicity
  - Parental Level of Education
  - Lunch, Test Preparation Course
  - Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing

## ðŸ“ˆ Problem Statement

> Predict whether a student will achieve a **high math score (>70)** using features like gender, parental education, test preparation, and other exam scores.

---

## ðŸ§  ML Techniques Used

- âœ… Feature Engineering:
  - Combined reading and writing scores (`rw_avg`)
  - Ordinal encoding of parental education
- âœ… One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
- âœ… Model Training:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost (tuned)
- âœ… Final Model:
  - **VotingClassifier Ensemble**
- âœ… Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`

## ðŸš€ Accuracy Achieved

| Model             | Accuracy   |
|------------------|------------|
| XGBoost (base)    | ~88%       |
| XGBoost (tuned)   | ~93â€“95%    |
| **Final Ensemble**| **>95% âœ…** |

## ðŸ§ª Prediction Pipeline

1. Preprocess new student data
2. Apply same feature engineering and encoding
3. Predict `high_math_score` (1 or 0)
4. Output prediction confidence (`predict_proba`)
5. Export results to `predicted_scores.csv`
